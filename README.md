bob - a bash only podcast publisher

PLEASE: DO NOT USE THAT UNLESS YOU DO NOT NEED TO REALLY PUBLISH A PODCAST

This is just a test to see if it is possible to write a podcast publisher in bash.
It is, maybe, but it will take a while to implement all features I have in mind (and you need to really publish a podcast).
